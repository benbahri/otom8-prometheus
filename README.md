# otom8-prometheus
Prometheus (https://prometheus.io) lab materials

This workshop is intended to be a work in progress.
Currently the workshop slides are in the pdf file on master

Each stage of the workshop is kept in a separate branch with the sequence being:
1. master
2. with-grafana
3. add_alerts
4. add_app

Yes I know, I should align the branch naming.

The plan is to gradually transfer the PDF contents to this README.
